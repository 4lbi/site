            Hi everyone, <br><br>

            My name is Alberto, and I'm here to tell you a little bit about myself.<br>
            I was born and raised in a little village near Verona in Italy, and I've lived there since now. I went to high school, and for now I'm in the University of Verona.
            Since then, I've been working in the field of IT for my interest by new technologies and the progress that a uman can do.<br><br>

            In my free time, I enjoy to teach my self new things to learn, so improve myself, I also enjoy sports in general, and music in particular, and I wish to play an instrument. I'm particularly passionate about technologies,<br>
            and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in that area.<br>
            When it comes to my personality, I would describe myself as absolutley introvert person. I'm someone who comprend things very well, try always something new because when i follw a routine for so long,
            this became very f-boring, and also I'm a good listener.<br><br>
            
            Overall, I'm excited to be here and to have the opportunity to get to know all of you better.<br><br>
        </p>
